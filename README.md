About Me

I am practicing academic with an entrepreneurial bent of mind who once had a torrid love affair with Physics. I have radically advanced in the field of Data Driven Consumer Engagement Strategies, Consumer Behavior Models and Technology driven new age businesses. I conduct short term programs on Data Visualization using Tableau and Machine Learning using R and Python.

I hold a doctorate in Operations Research from Indian Institute of Management Ahmedabad and a Post Graduate in Physics from University of Mumbai. I have advanced training in mathematical programming including optimization, advanced data analysis, and simulation techniques. When I am not teaching or consulting I can be found meditating or heading for an adventurous trek.
